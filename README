Gravatar
========

This plugin brings a mixin and a helper to associate Rails models with gravatar resources.


Example
=======

Simply mixin the Gravatar module into the model that needs to be associated with a gravatar resource:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    include Gravatar::Attributes
  end

It adds the `gravatar(..)` method to the User model. It returns a string representing the URL of the gravatar
respource associated with each record in the table:

  <%=h user.gravatar %>

It assumes that an attributed named `email` is defined, but you can use a different attributed by specifying the
name of the attribute:

  <%=h user.gravatar(:attr => :email_address) %>
  
You can further customise how the URL is computed by supplying additional options:

  <%=h user.gravatar(:attr => :email_address, :size => 25) %>
  <%=h user.gravatar(:attr => :email_address, :size => 25, :rating => 'g') %>
  <%=h user.gravatar(:attr => :email_address, :size => 25, :rating => 'g', :default => 'wavatar') %>
  <%=h user.gravatar(:attr => :email_address, :size => 25, :rating => 'g', :default => '/images/default.png') %>

See http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url for details on computing gravatar URLs.


### HTML Tag Helper

An HTML tag helper is included. Wherever you might use:

  <%= image_tag user.gravatar %>
  
Consider using:

  <%= gravatar_for user %>

It may also take the same options as the `gravatar(..)` method in the mixin:

  <%= gravatar_for user, { :attr => :email_address } %>

As well as HTML options, like the `image_tag` helper:

  <%= gravatar_for user, { :attr => :email_address }, { :border => 5 } %>
